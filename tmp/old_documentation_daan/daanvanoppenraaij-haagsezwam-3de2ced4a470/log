git pull on desktop, alarm library is not updated (freeAll). Laptop at home I have to wait to upload that modified library.
When that is done remove "ignored air" error.

laptop, improve the timer. Problem: two timers start at the same time, it uses the first timer in code and not time based and ignores the other one.
tried to improve, by ignoring 0's but now it does nothing. It should work. Find out why it ignores everything.
working version in older folder for comparison.
